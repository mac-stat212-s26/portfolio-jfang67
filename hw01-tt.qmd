Explore the week's [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge. Develop a research question, then answer it through a short data story with [effective visualization(s)]({{< var effective-viz-url >}}).  Provide sufficient background for readers to grasp your narrative.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

companies <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2026/2026-01-27/companies.csv")

ggplot(companies, aes(x = company_size, y = capital_stock)) +

  labs(
    title = "Capital stock by company size in Brazil",

Research Questions: How does capital stock vary by company size in Brazil?

To look at this, I compared declared capital stock across different company size categories using a boxplot. 
Most companies cluster at relatively low capital levels, while a small number of firms have extremely large capital stock values.
These outliers stretch the distribution and make the overall pattern highly right-skewed, especially for the small-enterprise and 'other' categories.
